					‚ÄúImitation‚Äù is the act of existing characteristics taking a different form to produce something new. 
					It is behavior, art, invention, and culture that strives to appear as the original once did.
				</p>
			  	<p>
					Imitation invites us to examine how the people, environments, and behaviors we interact with reveal 
					or induce shared identity and beliefs. On one hand, it is a foundational component of development, from 
					learning a language to developing social cues to using mimicry for survival. Similarly, it calls for a 
					thoughtful contemplation on what might require distinction. Imitation has the potential to not only express, 
					but magnify, critique, and inspire transformations. Whether imitation takes the form of parody, distorted 
					mirroring, or uncanny similarities, it depends on the power of perception.
				</p>
			  	<p>
					Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? It's a question that's been asked for centuries, but a 
					question that nonetheless fails to provide an answer. If art is anything that is created from the experience 
					of life, how does life play a role in its creation? Imitation allows us to consider the bidirectional 
					relationships that emerge amidst cycles of copy and paste.
			  	</p>
				<p>
					We believe imitation has the capacity to both extract from and build on the opportunities that are present in 
					that which is imitated. Perhaps imitation can provide insight into the future, and perhaps it can be a disservice 
					to the authenticity of the original. To what extent does imitation hinder, and to what extent does it create?

				<strong>‚ÄúImitation‚Äù</strong> is the act of reshaping existing characteristics into something new. It is behavior, art, invention, and culture that strives to resemble the original. It invites us to reflect on how our surroundings shape identity, and when imitation becomes a tool for understanding‚Äîor a call for distinction. 
				From childhood learning to social mimicry, imitation is foundational to how we grow and connect. It can amplify, critique, or transform what it reflects, whether through parody, mirroring, or subtle resemblance‚Äîits power lies in perception.
				Does art imitate life, or life imitate art? This age-old question speaks to the cyclical nature of creation. Imitation offers a lens into this loop, challenging us to consider what‚Äôs borrowed, what‚Äôs new, and what it all means.
