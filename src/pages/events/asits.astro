			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				Now, if you were to zoom into that point, you'd find your life play out
				before your eyes, your particular set of snapshots strung together into
				an all-too-familiar movie. But zoom back out, and the space spanned by
				your life story quickly collapses. All the details-- the emotions, the
				experiences, the moments that made you who you are-- get packaged into a
				personal time capsule, a punctuation mark on a galactic timeline barely
				inhabited by humanity.

				How easy it is to lose yourself in the chaos of it all.

				<em>"A Space in the Spectrum"</em> is the story of us. This theme captures
				our attempts to traverse the spectrum between our most intimate microcosms
				and the macrocosm too apathetic to learn even our names. It is here, in this
				inevitable struggle to balance the extreme dualities of our existence that
				we find perspective and ourselves: We can't hope to answer all the unknowns,
				but we can, however, fill in the space left for us. The universe only gives
				us a single point. But that’s enough space to capture a lifetime. And that's
				enough space to claim, <em>"This is who I am."</em>
