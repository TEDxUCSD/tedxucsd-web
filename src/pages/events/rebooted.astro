			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				This year's theme is “Rebooted.” It's a reminder to break from simply
				going through the motions and breathe. We often don't know where we're
				going until we've reflected on where we've been, and sometimes the
				shapes of our stories only emerge after we allow ourselves to step back
				and refresh. A reboot, therefore, is a chance for us to disconnect from
				the noise of mindless movement to rediscover what truly matters to us.

		title='Chicanosauruz at the Border'
		desc="Victor's talk reflects a parallel of his life as a Chicano that has been dealing with the issues in the most traveled border in the world. From his childhood to the present, immigration has been a four generations situation with Victor, his family, and community. The civil rights movements of the 60's and 70's were instrumental in influencing his art and activism, making him feel like a surfer riding a tsunami. After more than 50 years of work, Victor is feeling the same energy of creativity to produce murals and work that battle those Chicano issues."
