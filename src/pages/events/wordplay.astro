			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				<em>"Wordplay"</em> is born from wonder, stemming from the seesaw between
				the questions we have and the answers we seek about our world. In that dance,
				as we trace through our senses to make meaning from matter and turn particle
				to perception, we may find ourselves compelled to break the mold. We may
				seek to stray beyond the scope of the sensations we can (or cannot) experience,
				and let our individual intuitions step into light. A ‘sixth sense’ is something
				mysterious yet assuring; it gives us the resolve to walk in the world we
				see, and the one we want to create.
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				How we intake the information of the world is similar, but the
				culmination of each of our senses creates something completely and
				beautifully unique. What do you make of what you sense? How do you
				transform particle to perception?
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				Your sixth sense is now tingling–what do you say we follow it?

But how does this same concept apply to real life? Jacob Geller discusses how the design of the spaces we frequent affects our behavior, both in ways we can anticipate, and those we often fail to'
