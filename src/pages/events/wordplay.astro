			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				If we view language as a sandbox, what can be built? How can it
				be shaped? What are its powers and limits? How can we play with
				its words to reveal something that transcends the bounds of mere 
				words on a paper?
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				<em>"Wordplay"</em> is an examination of the diverse forms of expression
				that are used to convey ideas, share perspectives, and drive 
				change. With the wide range of languages used across the human 
				population, one thing that remains constant is the power that 
				words hold in connecting billions of people in a multifaceted 
				world. The sheer possibilities of language lie in the breadth 
				of its different interpretations and mediums, as it exists as 
				both a spoken and unspoken art form. 
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				Words impact us in more ways than simple characters on a sheet 
				of paper. The presence, or lack thereof, of language has the 
				power to influence our minds and expose our vulnerabilities. 
				It can empower us to reclaim our identities and be used to drive
				change. While words can be used to unites us, it also has the 
				ability to manipulate and create barriers between communities. 
				No matter the form, words have continued to be a vital tool in
				shaping communities, culture, and individuals. 
			</p>
			<p class ='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				Born from the realm of language, <em>"Wordplay"</em> encompasses the
				freedom of expression, the possibility within different forms
				of communication, and the nuances of meaning. We invite you to
				discover how words play into your own sandbox.
