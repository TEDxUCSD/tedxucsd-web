				"Wordplay" is an examination of the diverse forms of expression that are 
                used to convey emotions, drive change, and express ideas. The presence, or 
                lack thereof, of words has the power to influence our minds and expose our 
                vulnerabilities. Words can be used to unite us, but also have the ability 
                to manipulate and create barriers within each other. "Wordplay" encompasses 
                the freedom of expression, the possibility within different forms of 
                communication, and the nuances of meaning.
