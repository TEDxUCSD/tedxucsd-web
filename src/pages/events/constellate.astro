				Description
			</h2>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				As we grow up, we begin to apply a logic-heavy filter on our dreams. We
				begin to cap ourselves, sell ourselves short, and compare ourselves to
				others in exchange for stability, status, and more. Yet our hearts still
				yearn for more, but with this filtered-perspective, we are ultimately
				left feeling hopeless.
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				<em>"Constellate"</em> returns us to a world of child-like wonder, a time
				when the questions we asked were beyond ourselves–a time when we were so
				furiously curious of the immense space called the Unknown.
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				<em>"Constellate"</em> reminds us that we can only connect the dots as we
				go. When we embrace the fact that we each play a unique part in a bigger
				story, then one day, we will together be in awe and peace when we step back
				and see how our paths have gathered us together and intertwined to form an
				intricate constellation far more beautiful and magnificent than we could
				have ever imagined.
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-600 py-3'>
				So what do you say? Are you ready to traverse through a world of
				child-like wonder with us?
