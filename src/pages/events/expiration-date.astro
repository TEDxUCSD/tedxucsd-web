				"Expiration Date" explores the fleeting nature of existence, emphasizing how 
				the passage of time brings both progress and decline. This reflection extends 
				beyond the material world, touching on the expiration of ideas and societal norms. 
				It prompts consideration of whether expiration is arbitrary or predetermined, 
				urging proactive responses to time constraints. The ambiguity of expiration invites 
				innovation and nuance, highlighting the balance between temporariness and timeliness. 
				Ultimately, it invites contemplation on navigating life's transient journey amidst 
				constant change.
