						<span class='italic'>"Expiration Date"</span> explores the fleeting nature of
						existence, emphasizing how the passage of time brings both progress and decline.
						This reflection extends beyond the material world, touching on the expiration
						of ideas and societal norms. It prompts consideration of whether expiration is
						arbitrary or predetermined, urging proactive responses to time constraints. The
						ambiguity of expiration invites innovation and nuance, highlighting the balance
						between temporariness and timeliness. Ultimately, it invites contemplation on
						navigating life's transient journey amidst constant change. Join us for 
						TEDxUCSanDiego’s 12th annual conference for provocative talks, interactive 
						experiences, and to be a part of ideas worth spreading!
