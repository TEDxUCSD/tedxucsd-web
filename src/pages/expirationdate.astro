						existence, emphasizing how the passage of time brings both progress and decline.
						This reflection extends beyond the material world, touching on the expiration
						of ideas and societal norms. It prompts consideration of whether expiration is
						arbitrary or predetermined, urging proactive responses to time constraints. The
						ambiguity of expiration invites innovation and nuance, highlighting the balance
						between temporariness and timeliness. Ultimately, it invites contemplation on
						navigating life's transient journey amidst constant change. Join us for 
						TEDxUCSanDiego’s 12th annual conference for provocative talks, interactive 
						experiences, and to be a part of ideas worth spreading! Doors open at 3:00pm, event
						begins at 4:00pm.

			fname='Pascal'
			lname='Gagneux'
			title='We are the Planet Altering Ape'
			desc="Pascal Gagneux is a Professor of Pathology and Anthropology at UC San Diego and serves as CARTA's Executive Co-Director. The Gagneux laboratory studies cell-surface molecules in closely related primates species and how glycan evolution is shaped by constraints from endogenous biochemistry and exogenous, pathogen-mediated natural selection, but can also have consequences for sexual selection. Humans are the “planet-altering ape”. In his talk, “We are the Planet Altering Ape”, Dr. Gagneux encompasses our expansion across the globe, technological prowess, and booming populations that are causing the sixth mass extinction and threaten to hasten our own. We humans have evolved distinct capabilities: we cooperate at massive scales, we communicate with language, we are imaginative, and self-aware. Can we rely on our uniquely evolved features for solving these existential challenges?"
