				<p class='pt-8 pb-4 text-gray-700'>
					TED is an annual event where the world’s leading thinkers and doers
					are invited to share their passions. “TED” stands for Technology,
					Entertainment, Design - three broad subject areas that are shaping our
					future.
				</p>
				<p class='text-gray-700'>
					TEDxUCSD’s mission is to bring together leading thinkers and doers to
					share ideas that matter in and to any discipline - technology,
					entertainment, design, science, humanities, business, development, and
					much more. Through a local forum, we hope to inspire people to change
					their lives, their futures, and ultimately their world.
